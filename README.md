# Logo Server

A simple Express.js web server that serves the Swayatt logo image.

## What is this app?

This is a lightweight Node.js application built with Express.js that serves a single logo image (`logoswayatt.png`) when accessed through a web browser. When you visit the root URL, the server responds by displaying the Swayatt logo.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd "devops task"
How to Start the App

Run the following command:

npm start


The server will start and display:

Server running on http:54.91.162.247//:30152

Usage

Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

http:54.91.162.247//:30152

DevOps Task: CI/CD on EKS with Monitoring

⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. ### Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform)

The complete infrastructure (VPC, subnets, EKS cluster, node groups, IAM roles) is provisioned using Terraform.

After applying Terraform, an EKS cluster named my-eks-cluster is created and ready for deployments.

2. ### Jenkins Pipeline Configuration

The Jenkins pipeline automates the full CI/CD workflow with the following stages:

Build – Installs dependencies and builds the Node.js application.

SonarCloud Analysis – Runs static code analysis and pushes results to SonarCloud for code quality and vulnerability checks.

Dockerize – Builds a Docker image for the application using the provided Dockerfile.

Push to Amazon ECR – Pushes the Docker image to a private Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository.

Deploy to EKS – Applies Kubernetes manifests (deployment.yaml, svc.yaml, aws-auth.yaml) to deploy the application into the EKS cluster.

3### Kubernetes Access Control

An aws-auth.yaml ConfigMap is configured to map the Jenkins IAM user (jenkins-user) to Kubernetes RBAC.

This grants the Jenkins pipeline system:masters permissions, enabling it to run kubectl commands directly against the EKS cluster during deployments.

4. ### Logging & Monitoring

Installed Fluent Bit DaemonSet on the EKS cluster to forward container logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

Logs are available in the following CloudWatch log groups:

/aws/containerinsights/my-eks-cluster/application → Application logs

/aws/containerinsights/my-eks-cluster/dataplane → Kubernetes system logs

🛠️ Tools & Services Used

Terraform – Infrastructure provisioning (VPC, EKS, IAM, subnets, node groups).

Jenkins – CI/CD pipeline automation.

SonarCloud – Static code analysis and code quality checks.

Docker – Containerization of the Node.js application.

Amazon ECR – Private registry for storing Docker images.

Amazon EKS (Kubernetes) – Hosting and orchestrating application workloads.

Fluent Bit + CloudWatch – Centralized logging and monitoring.

GitHub – Source code repository.

⚡ Challenges Faced & Solutions

### IAM Authentication with EKS

Challenge: Jenkins user didn’t have access to run kubectl commands.

Solution: Configured aws-auth ConfigMap to map jenkins-user IAM role to Kubernetes system:masters.

🚀 Possible Improvements if Given More Time

External Access via ALB + Route 53 – Configure AWS ALB Ingress Controller and Route 53 DNS mapping for secure, scalable external access to the application.

End-to-End Observability – Instead of relying only on CloudWatch log groups, implement a full observability stack:

Prometheus & Grafana – Metrics collection and real-time visualization.

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) – Centralized log aggregation and advanced search.

Jaeger – Distributed tracing to track request flows across microservices.
